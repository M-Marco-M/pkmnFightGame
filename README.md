# pkmnFightGame

## What is it?

This game is a personal challenge to realize a web-app application from the database to the front-end view, so it's for study purpose.

## Which tecnology are used?

- The database is based on MySQL
- The backend side is based on Java + Spring
- The frontend side is based on TypeScript

## Why a Pokémon fight game?

I think it's a good challenge, Pokémons are perfect to test my knowledge about Java classes and interfaces, and general OOP programming skills.
It's a good challenge database-side too, specially for relations between Pokémon and their types and their moves.

An important motivation is that this relations are already structured and I know them quite good since I was a Pokémon game fan in childood, so I can focus on translate the relationship on Java and MySQL tables.

I also think that it will be fun ro create a game, especially a Pokémon game.
Like I said I was a fun when I was younger.
