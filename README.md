## What is it?

This game is a personal challenge to realize a web-app application from the database to the front-end view, so it's for study purpose.
The final goal is to make a replica of pokemon-games fight section.

## Which tecnology are used?

- The database is based on MySQL
- The backend side is based on Java + Spring
- The frontend side is based on TypeScript

## Why a Pokémon fight game?

I think it's a good challenge, Pokémons are perfect to test my knowledge about Java classes and interfaces, and general OOP programming skills.
It's a good challenge database-side too, specially for relations between Pokémon and their types and their moves.

An important motivation is that this relations are already structured and I know them quite good since I was a Pokémon game fan in childood, so I can focus on translate the relationship on Java and MySQL tables.

Also, there is are lot of resources and documentetion in the web about Pokémon, one above all PokéAPI.

I also think that it will be fun to create a game, especially a Pokémon game.
Like I said I was a fan when I was younger.

## Resources

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT was my initial choice to obtain data to insert in table on my local database
It was okay for data like Pokémon species in Pokédex and the list of the types.

### PokéAPI: https://pokeapi.co/

When it comes to obtain larger amount of data and information ChatGPT failed
so I used PokéAPI. I wrote some small scripts in JavaScript that select the datas I need
and manipulate them to obtain the exact query format.

(I'm gratefull there are so powerfull free resources by online community)
